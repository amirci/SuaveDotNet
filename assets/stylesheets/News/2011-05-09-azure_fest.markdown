Online Business Systems and Microsoft are teaming up to bring the cloud to Winnipeg with [Azurefest](www.azure.com)! 

This is your chance to take to learn from Microsoft's own John Bristowe on how to take you and your development into cloud with Microsoft. All you need to bring is your laptop, your credit card (to setup your Azure account, but you won't be charged for anything), and yourself to start developing ASP.NET web applications in the cloud.

So what are you waiting for? Register now!

For full details, check out the announcement on the Online Business Systems website.
