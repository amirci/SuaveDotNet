title: Ruby on Rails 101 Workshop
---

For all of you that want to learn about Ruby on Rails this is the opportunity!

The Winnipeb Ruby User Group is planning a workshop on a Sat to bootstrap a RoR project from scratch.

The idea is to spend the whole day learning how to start with RoR, show the benefits, etc.

The cost would be around $ 30 to cover food, snacks, etc...

The date is still TBD but will keep you posted.

Cheers!
